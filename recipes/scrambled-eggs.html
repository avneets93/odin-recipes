    <h3>Perfect looking eggs</h3>
    <p>Can I offer you a nice egg in these trying times?</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs
        <li>1 teaspoon mayonnaise or salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon margarine or butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water using a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat. Pour in the eggs, and stir constantly as they cook. Remove the eggs to a plate when they are set, but still moist. Do not over cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are on plate, but these are also good without.
