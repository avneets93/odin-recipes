    <h3>Delicious looking Fajita</h3>
    <p>As a lover of Mexican food who's recently gone meatless, 
        I decided to experiment with an idea for fajitas that would 
        be as close to the real thing as possible without 
        including meat. These turned out to be better than almost 
        any traditional fajitas I've ever had. Even my meat-loving 
        25-year-old son loved them, and wants more! 
        Authentic Southwestern fajita flavor with a smoky touch. 
        Very easy to make. Garnish with sour cream, salsa, and 
        grated cheese as desired.    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1â…“ cups water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons liquid smoke flavoring (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 (1 ounce) packages fajita seasoning</li>
        <li>4 large avocados - peeled, pitted, and sliced into 1/2-inch wedges</li>
        <li>4 large bell peppers - stemmed, seeded, and sliced into 1/2-inch wedges</li>
        <li>1 extra large onion, sliced into rings and rings separated</li>
        <li>12 (6 inch) flour tortillas</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk water, oil, liquid smoke, and fajita seasoning together in a bowl and pour into a resealable plastic bag.
